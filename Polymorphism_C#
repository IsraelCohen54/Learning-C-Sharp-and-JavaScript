//  C# Polymorphism example.
//  Polymorphism is achieved by having multiple objects with similar behavior but unique properties.
//  In this example, handlers and server-side object-oriented programming (*explained below) are used to create,
//  choose, and define elements and events:

//  (*)
//  Server-side object-oriented programming refers to a programming paradigm where the majority of the code logic
//  is executed on the server side of an application, rather than on the client side.
//  In this model, objects on the server are created, manipulated,
//  and interact with each other to carry out the necessary tasks for the application.
//  The resulting data is then sent to the client side to be displayed to the user.
//  This approach to programming is called "object-oriented" because the code is organized into objects,
//  each with its own properties and methods, and is executed on a server,
//  which is typically a centralized and more powerful system.
//  By utilizing server-side object-oriented programming,
//  developers can build applications that are more secure, scalable, and able to handle a large volume of data and user interactions.
